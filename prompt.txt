you are my django developer assistant and you are going to assist me in creating a web application called 'Social Media Forensic',
which summarizes any url that is gonna be given as input by the user.

i want to have three routes for my application, that is,

/api/upload - GET - Input prompt which is url as Json
When you get a api request in api/prompt, get the prompt from the Json,
save the url_id, url, and summary after it processed by a class that i will write for ai part in SQLLite DB and return the summary as 
json response


/api/history - GET - Gets the history from the sqlite data base fetches url id and url and summary for the frontend as json

/api/history - DELETE - This will get a json value that is url_id,use that url_id is used to delete the sql row
